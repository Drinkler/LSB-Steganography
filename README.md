# Steganography
My first and one of the simplest ways of steganography.

run "python3 steganography.py Picturename [Data which you would like to hide]" to Hide the data in the picture.

run "python3 decrypt_steganography.py Picturename [File to which the data will be saved]" to get the hidden data from the picture.
